# Conways-game-of-life
My attempt to simulate Conways game of life


I read about Conway's zero player game; The game of life. I thought trying to create my own simulation of this process by his rules would be a good learning exercise in c++. I found the implementation of the game fairly straightforward to write however, the image generation -> video render is more challenging.
Eventually I hope to build a GUI to house the code which will then start from user defined conditions and output a video of the result given the inital state of the system by the user. This may require other languages such as Java and will be a good learning process.
